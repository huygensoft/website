    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

    <div>
        <p>
            At Huygensoft Limited, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. 
            This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and share personal information 
            when you use our book readers and writers application.
        </p>

        <p>
            We collect personal information from you when you create an account, share a book, 
            or use certain features of the app. This may include your name, email address, payment 
            information, and reading preferences.
        </p>

        <p>
            We use your personal information to provide and improve the book readers and writers app, 
            process your transactions, and communicate with you. This may include sending you 
            promotional offers, updates on new releases, and other information about our products and services.
        </p>

        <p>
            We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing 
            purposes without your consent. We may share your personal information with service providers 
            who assist us with operating the app, such as payment processors and hosting providers.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you share a book on the app, your name will be publicly displayed as the author of the book. 
            If you do not want your name to be associated with your book, you can choose to use a pseudonym instead.
        </p>

        <p>
            You have the right to access, correct, and delete your personal information. You can exercise these 
            rights by contacting us through the app or using the contact information provided in this privacy policy.
